# DifferentFactorials
A bunch of different cool factorials calculated in Python. Inspired by blackpenredpens video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eboFOkRHr4)
A few quick explanations of the different factorials, but you really should watch the video for a better explanation.
# Double/N Factorial
Notated by 2/n exclamation marks after the number(ex. double factorial of 4=4!!), rather than one. Unlike a normal factorial, where you multiply the number by each number below it until you hit 1(ex. 4!=4\*3\*2\*1), for a double or n factorial, you multiply by an amount 2 or n less than the number. (ex. 6!!=6\*4\*2)
# Super Factorial-Pickover Edition
Pickover's version of a super factorial is notated using a $ after the number(e.x. super factorial of 5=5$). To calculate a super factorial, you raise the number to the power of itself an amount of times equal to itself-1(e.x. 5$=5^5^5^5^5).
